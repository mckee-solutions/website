# About McKee Solutions

Hi there. I'm Andy.

If I'm being totally honest, I started McKee Solutions because I liked the
domain name. Now, I use it as a platform to document and publicize my side
projects.

I've been a professional programmer for about ten years, and I haven't
stopped enjoying the work I do. It's challenging, fun, and never
gets stagnant due to the ever-changing world of technology and computing.
I love my wife, my two little girls, and even my pair of insanity-laced
dogs (most of the time).

I spend most of my programming life writing Java for a large-scale Spring
Framework web application. I have ventured into Kotlin, and absolutely
love it. I also have lots of experience with PHP (mostly customizing
WordPress), Groovy, and Python.
