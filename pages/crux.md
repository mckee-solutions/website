## About CRUX

CRUX (CRUd for XML) is a simple scripting language for changing
an XML document. It was born out of the necessity to script changes
to XML configuration files on servers without all the extra work that
goes into a "real" XML transformation utilities like XSLT or XQuery.

The overall mission of CRUX is to give an end user the ability to
provide an input XML file and a CRUX script to a CRUX processor to get
a modified version of the XML file back.

See the specification documentation for more information.
