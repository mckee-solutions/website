### v0.1

## Syntax

A CRUX script is a series of lines of commands. Each line constitutes
a standalone command to be executed against an input XML document.

### Commands

A CRUX command is comprised of three parts:

1. A **verb**
2. The **location**, in the form of an XPATH expression.
3. A **value** indicating the XML snippet to insert (`create` commands)
   or replace with (`update` commands).

#### Verbs

The current supported verbs are:

1. `replace` - For elements, replaces the content of the node at
   **location** with **value**. For attributes, replaces the value
   of attribute at **location** with **value**.
2. `delete` - Deletes (omits in output) the node at **location**.
3. `append` - For elements, adds element **value** as the *last* child
   of the element node at **location**. For attributes, adds an
   attribute **value** formatted like "@attribute-name=the attribute
   value" as the *last* attribute for the element. Attribute paths at
   **location** are invalid.
4. `prepend` - For elements, adds element **value** as the *first* child
   of the element node at **location**. For attributes, adds an
   attribute **value** formatted like "@attribute-name=the attribute
   value" as the *first* attribute for the element. Attribute paths
   at **location** are invalid.

### Comments

A CRUX comment is a line that begins with a hash mark (pound sign). No
following space is required.

## What are the rules for a CRUX processor?

### I/O

A CRUX implementation may be in any language as long as it can:

1. Be run from the command line
2. Accept an XML document as a stream via `stdin`
3. Output a new XML document as a stream via `stdout`
4. Process an XML document in an event-driven way (as opposed to DOM)

### Processing

The input XML document is processed without any modifications.
